## Disclaimer

Cardinal-Anticheat is a **free** [**Spigot**](https://github.com/SpigotMC) anticheat which blocks most of the known cheats out there. Keep in mind, that Cardinal-Anticheat is still in beta, false postives may occurre... 

## Installation

First navigate to the [**release**](https://github.com/Clientastisch/Cardinal-Anticheat/releases) tab and download the newest version available. After the download move the `CAC.jar` into the `plugins` folder. The `CACApi.jar` **is only for development purpose** and should not be moved inside the `plugins` folder too.

# Commands

cac flag    - Shows the flags/alerts
cac ban     - Bans a player permanently
cac unban   - Unbans a player
cac info    - Tells you whether a player is banned or not
cac iptable - Adds the ip-address of a player to the firewall rule and prevents any further communication
cac replay  - Watch a replay which has been recorded before
cac report  - A custom report system only for stuffs in which each flag will be a 'report' which will be stored
cac reset   - Resets the violations of a player
cac reboot  - Restarts the plugin
cac reload  - Reloads configurations
cac export  - Export the current settings into a single file
cac import  - Import a setting from a file


## Addons ([**documentation**](http://cac.dodo1213.de/doc/allclasses-noframe.html))

1. First things first, download the `CACApi.jar` of the newest [**release**](https://github.com/Clientastisch/Cardinal-Anticheat/releases)
2. Add `CACApi.jar` as you dependency. It's **only** a placeholder, nothing you should move inside your `plugins` folder
3. Instead of `extends JavaPlugin` you have to `implement Addon` which requires two methods:

```java
import me.clientastisch.extension.Extension;
import me.clientastisch.extension.impl.Addon;

public class Core implements Addon {

    @Override
    public void onEnable() throws Exception {
    
    }

    @Override
    public void onDisable() throws Exception {

    }
}
```

4. Unlike spigot, a file called `addon.json` must be created like following:

```json
{
  "name": "MyAwesomeAddon",
  "author": "Me",
  "main": "my.path.to.core",
  "version": "v1.0"
}
```

5. Export your addon to `plugins//CAC//addons`
6. Reload your server or use `/cac addon load <addon>` and you're done!

## Power of addons

Addons are supported for every [**Spigot**](https://github.com/SpigotMC) version on which Cardinal-Anticheat is supported too. This gives you the ability to create multiversion extensions. Futhermore, you get access to a [**bunch of events**](http://cac.dodo1213.de/doc/allclasses-noframe.html) which are either packet or spigot based and access to some player-data collected by the anticheat which gives you some additional information which spigot doesn't provide on its own.

### Bugs & False positives

If any bugs or false positives occurre **report** them [**here**](https://github.com/Clientastisch/Cardinal-Anticheat/issues/new/choose). <br>
Otherwise I'll probably never notice them
