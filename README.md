## Disclaimer

Cardinal-Anticheat is a **free** [**Spigot**](https://github.com/SpigotMC) anticheat which blocks most of the known cheats out there. Keep in mind, that Cardinal-Anticheat is still in beta, false postives may occurre...

Cardinal-Anticheat also contains a custom build-in replay system which is quite usable to check whether a player was cheating or not. The output-file is a .zip file ~ 5MB depending on the amount of worlds used and their size.

## Important

If you're using multiversion to allow players of any version to join false positives will occurre...
In case your server is on 1.8 and players with versions higher than that are able to you disable at least following detections:

+ yMotion
+ Speed Type A

After testing different legit clients, I came to the conclusion that they are not considered as legit and will be detected from some detections.

These violations aren't the fault of Cardinal-Anticheat if they aren't possbile to reproduce with Vanilla. **The only legit thing out there is still vanilla!** However, in case you want those to allow those *legit-client* users playing on your server, there's an addon available on my discord in #addons
